Welcome to the documentation site for the esmBot project! This site is intended to document more technical information about the esmBot software itself.

If you want to run your own instance of esmBot, you might be looking for the [Setup](setup.md) page. If you're just looking to add the bot to your server, head over to [https://esmbot.net/invite](https://esmbot.net/invite).
